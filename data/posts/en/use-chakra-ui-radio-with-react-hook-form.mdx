Building forms is a core challenge in web application development. We need to manage data,
handle validation, and support various UI components. React Hook Form streamlines this process,
making it easier to integrate custom components like Chakra UI’s Radio buttons.

In this article, we’ll explore how to wire up Chakra UI’s Radio component using React Hook Form.
While we’ll focus on the radio group specifically, the same pattern applies to most custom inputs.

First, install Chakra UI and React Hook Form:

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/react react-hook-form
```

React Hook Form’s `Controller` lets you wrap custom components and integrate
them into your form’s state and validation.

Here’s a complete example:

```typescript
import { Box, Button, Stack, Radio, RadioGroup } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { Controller, useForm } from "react-hook-form";

export const Component = () => {
  const {
    control,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { isSubmitting },
  } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = handleSubmit((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });

  return (
    <Box as="form" onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <Controller
        name="gender"
        control={control}
        render={({ field: { value, onChange } }) => (
          <RadioGroup value={value} onChange={onChange}>
            <Stack>
              <Radio value="Male">Male</Radio>
              <Radio value="Female">Female</Radio>
              <Radio value="Other">Other</Radio>
            </Stack>
          </RadioGroup>
        )}
      />
      <Button type="submit" isLoading={isSubmitting}>
        Save
      </Button>
    </Box>
  );
};
```

I hope this helps you integrate Chakra UI’s radio component smoothly with React Hook Form.
